# RtcLib

This is an Arduino library for the DS3231 RTC (Real Time Clock).
The DS32331 class is forked from Sodaq_DS3231
DateTime and TimeSpan are derived from the adafruit/RTClib
and TimerClock24h was added by me

## Main goal
Provide simple RTC functionality for a timer clock

				Updated the samples


## Old README

RDS3231 Class is by Seeed Technology Inc(http://www.seeedstudio.com) and used
in Seeeduino Stalker v2.1 for battery management(MCU power saving mode)
& to generate timestamp for data logging. DateTime Class is a modified
version supporting day-of-week.
